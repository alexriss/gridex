# grid*ex*

Python scripts to analyze 3D grid data. It currently works for Nanonis data (in binary or ASCII file format).

Fitting [KPFM (Î”f vs. V) curves](http://www.nature.com/nnano/journal/v7/n4/abs/nnano.2012.20.html), [IZ spectroscopy](http://www.nature.com/nmat/journal/v9/n4/abs/nmat2625.html) curves, as well as a number of Gaussian peaks is implemented.

An example output is shown here:

Also check out the [example jupyter notebook](https://github.com/alexriss/gridex/blob/master/gridex_ipython_example.ipynb). The interactive controls are not displayed when renderring it, but will be available when running the notebook.
